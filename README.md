# INX Future Inc Employee Performance Analysis
## **Project Summary** 
INX Future Inc. has observed a decline in employee performance, leading to increased escalations and an 8% drop in client satisfaction. To address this, a data science project was initiated to analyze employee performance, identify key influencing factors, and provide recommendations for improvement.

## **Requirement**
The data for this project was provided by **IABACâ„¢** and is based on **INX Future Inc.** (referred to as INX). INX is a leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with over 15 years of global presence and has been consistently rated among the top 20 best employers over the past 5 years.

*Note: The data is not sourced from a real organization.*  

The entire project was conducted in **Jupyter Notebook** using the **Python** programming platform.

### ii) **Project Workflow**
#### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Data loading
- Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
#### 2. **Data Pre-processing**
- Checking null values
- Checking duplicates
- Checking corrupted values
- Identifying & Handling the outliers (Boxplot & Winsorize)
- Handling skewness (Log1p Transformation)
- Encoding categorical features (LabelEncoder)
- Feature scaling (MinMaxScaler)
- Feature selection
- Feature Balancing (SMOTE)
- Splitting dataset into training & testing sets (train_test_split)
  
#### 3. **Machine Learning Models**
The project implements multiple machine learning models & one deep learning model for multi-class classification:
